chickenStyle is a package that can help developers
to speed up the process of creating textstyles in general.
as we know the more complex the page we create
the more we interact with textstyle.
designing the textstyle in each widget is a very tiring job,
and you definitely won't be able to be consistent in your work.
chickenStyle comes like a class in CSS, where is the declaration of this class
we save it in a different file, and we can call that class anytime and anywhere
Apart from that, we don't need to declare classes one by one,
you just type one line of bash code and you will get
more than 20 textstyle classes ready to use.
In that class you can define colors, font family, fontweight and others..
